## Chocolate cinnamon raisin oats
I began my day with one of my favourite breakfasts that I developed to get myself to enjoy oats many years back (which was a success). I microwaved **1/2 cup rolled oats** with **1 cup oat milk** for about 3 mins, stirring halfway. There are some pockets of liquid at this point but I stop cooking as these set and it results in a softer, creamier consistency than if you ensure that all the liquid is fully absorbed. 

It used to seem a bit weird to use oats with oat milk but it isn't really if you think of the crazy ways in which dairy products are combined, like cheese with butter and butter with milk. Oat milk has the creamy part of the oats so by adding it to your rolled oats, you just make them creamier. 

While the oats are cooking I chopped around **2-3 small pieces (or squares although they are rectangular) of dark chocolate**. I prefer to chop them with a serrated bread knife as it results in lots of shaving-like pieces that can be dispersed across the top of the oats. I used Green & Blacks 85% as this is a good-tasting chocolate that is not wildly expensive. The rest of the topping comprises around  **1-2 tbsp raisins** and about **1/2 tsp** cinnamon.

Scatter the chocolate and raisins evenly over the top of the oats. Use a knife or spoon to tip the chocolate from the chopping board as it will melt with body heat if you use your fingers, especially if finely chopped. Sprinkle the cinnamon on top.

The chocolate melts in a few moments to form glossy pools in between the raisins. Indulgent-looking but quite a healthy bowl of oats: just a touch of dark chocolate and natural sweetness from the raisins

It's also rather tasty with a scattering of crunchy nuts. Reduce the chocolate a bit if you like to balance the fat content. Here I have swapped the raisins for chunky pieces of toasted whole almonds:

Just a quick glimpse of my lunch, which is thanks to my mother. It is a dish of Indian spiced garden-grown chard and black-eyed and small brown beans, tossed into hot rice. It's a classic South Indian style of eating rice "mixed" with spices and vegetables. Something crunchy and something spicy are mandatory accompaniments. Here I've got a spoonful of hot mango pickle and poppadums. A healthy low-fat dish except for the deep-fried poppadums (but not too many of them) and pickle oil (not too much of it).  -->

## Orange cookies that began life as macarons

The biscuits below began life in a bowl of whipped aquafaba foam. To be precise about **1/4 cup aquafaba** whipped for about 8-10 minutes, with **2-3 little pinches of cream of tartar** added after the first few minutes, until it became very foamy and formed soft peaks. Realising that I had run out of caster sugar, I tried to substitute **5 tbsp powdered jaggery** ground togther with the approximately *1 tbsp* caster sugar that I had left. I added the sugars 1-2 tablespoons at time and instead of transforming into stiff shiny peaks the mixture, although it thankfully didn't deflate, become more slack, settling into a thick frothy mixture.

At this point decided to save the nuts I had prepared for macarons for later. I had been glancing through a recipe for *langues du chat* and decided to convert the mixture into cookies inspired by these. I preheated the oven to 200 and lightly greased a greaseproof paper lined baking tray with a little sunflower oil.

I beat another **2 tbsp of powdered jaggery**  with about **2-1/2 tbsp of vegan butter (Flora)**, adding about **1/8 tsp cardamom** and the zest of half an orange. Then I mixed about in **1/2 cup of wholewheat flour**. 

Then I folded in a few tablespoons of the meringue mixture to create a thick batter like consistency, before carefully folding in the rest along with **a pinch of bicarbonate of soda / baking soda**. I placed 20 spoonfuls of the mixture shaped into rough rounds, spaced apart, on the baking tray and baked for about 8 minutes.

They were a cross between a cake and biscuit, a little bit crispy round the edges, chewy and soft round the middle. They are rather sweet in the manner of Indian sweets possibly due to the jaggery with a noticeable orange flavour. I can't really taste the cardamom probably because I added too little. But all in all rather a satisfactory rescue attempt.
