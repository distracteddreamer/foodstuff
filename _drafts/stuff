<!-- I don't know what is pancetta and to be honest I couldn't care less. However a desire to maintain at least a semblance of authenticity prompted me to read the Wikipedia page whereupon I discovered that traditionally a different cure meat product called *guanciale* is used in pancetta. I noted down the spices used in its preparation (black or red pepper, fennel, garlic) and glanced through the Wikipedia entry on carbonara and a few other recipes, coming away with the idea that you make a raw egg mixture into which pasta is tossed and to which you can add various cheeses and other (not always traditional) ingredients like cream and fried garlic. 

I have made no attempt to develop a vegan version of carbonara just a meal that contains ingredients I want to use up, which was inspired by that pasta dish.  -->
