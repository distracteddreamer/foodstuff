## "Anda" paratha 

I saw this recipe on BBC Food for a spicy Indian omelette topped flatbread and was tempted to make it for breakfast the next day. Chickpea flour omelette is an authentic vegan substitue for the egg-based version so this was the natural choice. Looking at a number of recipes it seems that unleavened flat breads are typically used but I happened to have some of my all purpose yeasted dough leftover, which I use for anything from rolls to pizza to flatbreads. Strictly speaking I made a kind of thin naan bread rather than paratha. 

I think many kinds of thin Indian-style flatbread would work here. You can make them in advance or you could use shop-bought ones. you can make the flatbreads in advance. To make a big batch of dough place these in a large bowl

- 2 cups of wholewheat flour (I typically use atta which is a very finely ground variety that yields a softer bread even though wholegrain)
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 tsp yeast
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp olive oil

Add enough warm water a little at a time to get a soft but firm dough. Knead until very smooth. Cover and allow to double in size (about 1 hour) before kneading to the original size for shaping. You can also let it rise slowly in the fridge. I tend to keep it in the fridge for a few days, kneading it down every now and again.

Roll lime-sized balls of dough into thin discs. Heat a frying pan/skillet/griddle over a high heat until very hot, then lower the heat. Place a flatbread on the pan, cook for about 2-3 minutes until it puffs up and has dark brown spots underneath. Then flip and allow it to cook for about 2 minutes until brown spots appear on the other side. Keep them aside whilst you make the omelette. You don't need to worry about keeping them warm as they will be heated again.

To make the omelette, I followed the linked recipe fairly closely. Place **5 tbsp chickpea flour** and **1/4 tsp baking powder** in bowl and pour in a little at a time about **75 ml** of water whisking all the time until you end up with a very thin batter (rather like a crÃªpe batter). Then whisk continuously for 1 minute (use a timer if you can) until you can see quite a few bubbles. 

In another bowl place

- 3 cherry tomatoes, chopped (about 2 tbsp in total)
- 1 small green chilli, finely chopped
- 1 small clove of garlic finely chopped
- 1/2 a medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp fresh coriander, finely chopped
- 1 tsp toasted cumin seeds

Sprinkle a few pinches of chickpea flour on top and toss very lightly to coat. This will stop the vegetables from sinking when added to the omelette batter. Add them to the chickpea flour mixture along with **1/4 tsp** salt and mix briefly just to disperse them through the batter. 

Heat a frying pan/skillet/griddle, lightly brushed with oil, over a medium-low heat, pour about **1/4 cup** of the mixture and spread out the back of a spoon until it makes a circle roughly the size of the flatbread (but can be a bit smaller). 

As soon as the omelette begins to set, place a flatbread on top and press down with the back of a spoon to ensure that it has adhered well to the omelette. Cook for 1-2 minutes until well-browned underneath (lift up a corner and peek), then flip and let it cook for another couple of minutes on the other side. Enjoy hot. 

## Deli-style open sandwiches 

These sandwiches were inspired by the need to prepare a tasty lunch quickly and by the availability of some good quality sourdough bread, a new green chickpea hummus picked up in the supermarket, some veggie sausages and various condiments. Whilst I have named them "deli-style" I make no claim to authenticity. 

I cut the long slices of bread in half lengthwise and toasted them in griddle where I also cooked the sausages. Then I slathered the slices with hummus, arranged diagonally sliced sausage and gherkin on top, topped with shredded garden chard, ribbons of coleslaw and dash of hot sauce. 


## Jota with Zganci
My culinary endeavours of the morning and afternoon had left me with half an onion and the realisation that I had huge jar of sauerkraut that probably needed to be consumed soon. I also remembered there was also a cup of cooked beans. All these led to one conclusion: jota. 

It is kind of like bean chilli but with the acidity mostly owing to the pickled cabbage rather than the touch of tomato that is used, the reddish colour of the dish owing to the generous addition of smoked paprika. 


about 1 cup sauerkraut
about 1 cup cooked red kidney beans
3/4 of a medium potato, diced
1/2 a medium onion, finely chopped
2 cloves of garlic, ginely chopped 
1 heaped tsp smoked paprika
2 tbsp passata

chopped parsley


1/2 cup cornmeal
about 2 cups water
